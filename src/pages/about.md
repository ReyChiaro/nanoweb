# About Me

Hello! I am a creative professional passionate about technology and design.

This website is a collection of my thoughts, projects, and photographs. I believe in minimalism and efficiency, which is why I built this site to be as fast and clean as possible.

## What I do

*   **Software Development:** Building robust applications.
*   **Photography:** Capturing moments (check out my [Gallery](/gallery)).
*   **Writing:** Sharing knowledge through my [Blog](/blog).

Feel free to look around!
